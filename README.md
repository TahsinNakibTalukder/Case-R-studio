# Case-R-studio
Forecasting models including ARIMA.

Introduction:
The objective of this case is to perform forecast on German retail sales from April 2020 to December 2020. As part of forecasting, we aim to develop an appropriate forecasting method (additive and multiplicative Holt-Winters and ARIMA) and compare with a benchmark model. Also included are point forecasts and prediction intervals. We also check if chosen method performs better using different estimation and hold-out samples.

Primary data analysis
We performed decomposition on the data series from Jan 2002 - Mar 2020 to check the components. Figure 1 shows a prominent seasonal component after decomposition. The consistent peaks and troughs at regular time intervals confirming presence of seasonality in the data. However, the trend remains almost constant and rises from 2015 to 2020.
